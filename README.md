COVID-19 analysis for March 2021 outbreak in Mauritius.

Incidence data was collected from websites of newspapers (L'Express and Le Defi), and therefore all analysis will depend on the accuracy of these data.

Estimates of serial interval and its standard deviation were obtained from the pre-print below:

More accurate estimates may be available in other articles but by far the most accurate estimate would be to measure serial interval locally in Mauritius. Failing this, this approach is next best strategy.
